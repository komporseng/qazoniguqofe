Be that as it may, it is still clear that for her, her family matters a lot. According to her, her parents have been her great support. It was also them who realized she had the talents for an artist.</p><p>She was only in the sixth grade when her teacher noticed her talent for storytelling and advised her parents to help her channel her creativity. So, after auditioning for three years without landing a role, Isabel who initially attended school in person was switched to online schooling from the tenth grade so that she could focus more on her acting.</p><p>Following that, Isabel’s parents even got her an agent and always helped her make up her mind when she was indecisive about starting her career in the industry.</p><p>So, her parents have been with her throughout the process. In Isabel’s words, they have been her main driving force as they believed in her and kept encouraging her even when she failed to crack auditions. They taught her to struggle and give the craft her all regardless of the role and outcome.</p><p>Isabel was born to her parents in&nbsp;Santa Monica, California, in the United States.</p><h3><strong>Does Isabel May Have Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Isabel seemed like the only child of her parents. If she has any siblings, she has not yet revealed them on any of her interviews or social media sharing.</p><h3><strong>Is Barrett Carnahan Isabel May’s Boyfriend IRL?</strong></h3><p>Isabel May is also quite reserved when it comes to putting her thoughts on her relationship status or dating life. She had not revealed much on these topics as of the time of this writing.</p><p>Even so, this has not stopped her fans from speculating about her supposed relationship with Alexa & Katie costar Barrett Carnahan.</p><p>Among other roles that she did Isabel is mostly known for starring in the Netflix Emmy-nominated series Alexa & Katie (2018).&nbsp;While she played the titular Katie Cooper for the series’ three-season run that featured 39 episodes, her rumored boyfriend and co-star Barrett appears in the show as Aiden.</p><p>However, now that we look at it, these rumors simply had no grounds and were made only on Isabel and Barrett’s incredible one-of-a-kind on-screen chemistry. Because afterward, we also learned that the Nickelodeon star had been in a long-term relationship with Nina Kubicki before they tied the knot in June 2020.</p><p>With that being said, Isabel’s current relationship status was still not understood. And as even her IG does not provide a window into it. So, to us, she seemed rather committed to furthering her career.</p><h3><strong>What Are Some Popular Movies Starring Isabel May?</strong></h3><p>Isabel May made her acting debut in the series Young Sheldon back in 2918. She played Veronica Duncan in a total of nine episodes.</p><p>From there, she went on to play Zoe Hull in the 2020 film Run, Hide, Fight. And, as of December 2021, she had two other projects in post-production: one was a film titled I Want You Back, with co-stars Scott Eastwood and Jami Gertz and next was The Moon & Back, a comedy about a high school student.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Isabel May Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Isabel May had above an estimated $300K net worth in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Isabel May?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Born on 1 November 2000 (as per IMDB), Isabel turned 21 in 2021.
