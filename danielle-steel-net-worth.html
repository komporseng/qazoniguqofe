class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joseph Hill Whedon, a&nbsp;third-generation writer, was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon data-lasso-id=112168 data-wpel-link=external>born on June 23, 1964</a>, in New York City, United States of America.</p><p>Joss’ father, Tom Whedon, is a renowned screenwriter for major hit series and films such as The Golden Girls and Alice in Wonderland. While his&nbsp;grandfather, John Whedon, is known for his work on radio and The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s.</p><p>Whedon’s mother, Ann Lee, had a small fan base for her work as an activist at Riverdale Country School, where she inspired many with her visions as a feminist.</p><p>The family’s influence and love for drama resulted in family trips, which included reciting Shakespeare and other influential writers.</p><p>This, unfortunately, became an issue with the family, as Joss has reported how he and his two brothers would go through some sort of punishment from their parents if they were not creative or witty enough.</p><p>Joss experienced some childhood trauma at the age of 5 when his best friend drowned.</p><p>Four years later, Joss’s parents divorced, which didn’t help the already struggling child. To escape, Joss watched countless television shows.</p><p>Later on, Joss attended the same school his mother worked at and then attended a boarding school for three years when he was a teenager.</p><p>During his time at the boarding school, Joss was bullied regularly. This did not stop him from excelling though, and he later graduated from Wesleyan University. The university later honored him with a Doctor of Letters in 2013.</p><p>Before graduating, Joss met a film enthusiast named Jeanine Basinger, who became his mentor.&nbsp;Immediately after graduation, Joss started on the outline of the Buffy series, which was to be his big break.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even with a future masterpiece in the making, Joss made his start as a writer on the sitcom, “Roseanne”.</p><p>During his time writing for the sitcom, Joss put the finishing touches on his cult classic, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which was released in 1997. The series received an amazing response from the fans, which led Joss to create the prequel, Angel, released in 1999.</p><p>Actors such as <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/pedro-pascal-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112169 data-wpel-link=internal>Pedro Pascal</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/amy-adams-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112170 data-wpel-link=internal>Amy Adams</a> made a name for themselves after appearing on the show.</p><p>Joss started work on a sci-fi series, Firefly, which was warmly received and ran from 2002 to 2003. Because of the great reviews, he produced a prequel called Serenity in 2005. Unfortunately, it was not as successful as his previous work.</p><p>He tried releasing another sci-fi series, Dollhouse, which ran from 2009 to 2010 and it too, was not a great success.</p><p>Joss made a comeback with his co-written creation, The Cabin in the Woods, in 2012. <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/jesse-williams-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112171 data-wpel-link=internal>Jesse Williams</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/bradley-whitford-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112172 data-wpel-link=internal>Bradley Whitford</a> made a name for themselves in the movie, which was widely applauded by the critics.</p><p>He then penned the internationally renowned movie, The Avengers, in 2012 to further critical acclaim. <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/mark-ruffalo-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112173 data-wpel-link=internal>Mark Ruffalo</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/cobie-smulders-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112174 data-wpel-link=internal>Cobie Smulders</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/chris-evans-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112175 data-wpel-link=internal>Chris Evans</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/robert-downey-jr-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=112176 data-wpel-link=internal>Robert Downey Jr.</a> all appeared in the movie that broke box office records worldwide.</p><p>Joss made a huge success in taking some of the stories from the <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/most-expensive-comic-books/ data-lasso-id=112177 data-wpel-link=internal>most expensive comic books in the world</a> and turning them into relatable characters.</p><p>After his success with Marvel, Joss released a sequel called The Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2015.

Focus On The Good Parts Of Life And Don’t Dwell On The Bad Parts</h3><p>Joss battled with childhood trauma and, because of this, could not sometimes see the bigger picture.</p><p>He had come&nbsp;to realize that no matter how dark times got, there was&nbsp;always a brighter future just around the corner.</p><h3>2. Different Is Good</h3><p>There have been many negative critiques of Joss’s work, as it is unique in certain aspects and hard to follow.</p><p>But this is what made Joss’s work so successful, as it wasn’t the same formula that scriptwriters had been over-using.</p><h3>3. Face Your Fears</h3><p>Joss sometimes must go out of his comfort zone to write about his characters in a way that reveals their full capabilities.</p><p>But this does not stop Joss from creating his masterpieces, it just proves to be a particularly stressful time for Joss.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary></span>Summary&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After releasing the Buffy series, Joss was marked as a screenwriter who could make magic happen.</p><p>With his move to Marvel studios and the huge success of his movies, he has become one of the most remarkable and influential writers in Hollywood.</p><p>But, unfortunately, with the fame and awards come the downsides of public life, and his family has suffered as a consequence.
