She knew she wanted to be a journalist from a young age, so after graduating from Clarke High School in Ontario, she enrolled in Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology and graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism. When she was 23, she relocated to Los Angeles to further her career.</p><p>She is quite private about her personal life, but she did mention her father’s death on December 14, 2012, and her mother’s remarriage on December 18, 2017, both of which she was very supportive of. Rachel was big assistance on her wedding day, according to her mother, and having her there meant a lot and made the day more meaningful.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Rachel_Bonnetta_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Rachel Bonnetta?

As of early 2020, her <strong>net worth</strong> is believed to be $5 million.</p><h2><span id=Rachel_Bonnetta-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Rachel Bonnetta- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>She has been in a committed relationship since January 3, 2016. Unfortunately for Rachel’s supporters, little is known about her partner or their relationship. What is known is that the couple is dating long distances. Rachel made this clear when she mentioned him on her Instagram page. Pete, her boyfriend, is in his early thirties. Pete and Rachel’s anniversary appears to be on New Year’s Day, based on her Instagram posts. On October 1, 2018, she shared a photo of the couple attending a farm-style wedding.</p><h2><span id=Rachel_Bonnetta-_Professional_Career>Rachel Bonnetta- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Rachel’s first professional employment was three years as a Brand Ambassador for Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment.<br>She was appointed as a host for YTV’s “The Zone” in 2013, and she has since hosted additional television programs such as “The Whip.” She landed a job with Major League Soccer (MLS) and hosted two of their shows, “MLS Now” and “Off-Topic,” quickly becoming well-liked, and her ideas were frequently implemented. The video “Rachel vs Rachel vs Frankie: MLS Cup Edition” was one such concept.</p><p>She has been the host of Fox Sports Channels’ “Lock It In” since September 2018.</p><p>She has also operated a YouTube channel, “The Buzzer,” for about six years, where she uploads sporting and comedic videos, as well as viral stories. The channel has just over 5,000 subscribers and has received over seven million views in total, although she no longer puts videos on it on a regular basis.</p><p>Her interests are not limited to journalism; she also enjoys performing. She participated in acting classes after moving to New York City in 2015. Although she enjoys it a lot, she simply acts for the sake of having fun and not to pursue it as a career.</p><p>Frankie Hejduk, a retired Los Angeles Galaxy soccer player, is one of her closest friends. In an interview with “World Soccer Talk,” she stated that Frankie is one of her favorite persons and holds a particular place in her heart. She also stated that he consumes 12 shots of espresso per day. She criticizes those who merely wanted to be friends with him before he retired. Rachel now resides in Los Angeles and is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.<br>Hobbies, favorite items, and fascinating facts<br>Rachel rose to prominence in 2018 after broadcasting a 30-minute live stream of a FIFA World Cup game in Russia on her Twitter account.</p><p>Following a trip to India, she established a GoFundMe campaign to oppose the conditions she saw the people living in. The page raised enough funds to install plumbing in a hamlet, purify their drinking water, and enhance their hygiene. Rachel has also been active in various humanitarian ventures, such as Community Rise, a non-profit organization with which she traveled to Ghana alongside Ghanaian-born MLS players (who are members of the group).</p><p>One of the athletes hadn’t seen his family in five years, and she described the experience as dramatic and heartfelt. The crowd’s reaction to the player was astounding, as they all recognized him and rushed around him the instant he arrived. Rachel sees their two-week stay as a life-changing experience since the athlete was well-liked in his community. She has a special fondness for dogs and frequently posts images of herself and her dog playing football.</p><p>On June 19, 2018, she pranked her admirers by posting a photo of herself with a baby bump, but subsequently admitted it was a joke.<br>Appearance</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Her hair is long and brown, and her eyes are green.
