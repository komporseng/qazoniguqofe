In 2018, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1vvPUpP2bQiE7Zi9 href=#>Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> had been plunged into senior football with a debut against <a class=ath_autolink data-id=656 href=#>Tottenham Hotspur</a>, before games against <a class=ath_autolink data-id=655 href=#>Manchester United</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=652 href=#>Chelsea</a>. Wan-Bissaka, aged 20, didn’t just cope with that pressure; he thrived, eventually making the right-back position his own and earning a £45million transfer to United in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>It is far too early to suggest Ozoh, 18, might have a similar career trajectory based on one appearance, but he coped admirably in trying circumstances against last season’s treble winners. Handed his opportunity as a result of injuries and illness, he was tenacious, determined and aggressive, delivering the kind of performance that suggests he is ready for further involvement.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/19075841/GettyImages-1859984726-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1937 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>David Ozoh, right, made a big impact at Manchester City (Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)</span><p>The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6 href=#>Premier League</a> is unforgiving and young players often only get a chance through injuries. That is more pronounced with Hodgson, who sets up his teams to minimise risk, meaning experience is usually prioritised. Players have to earn his trust and, on this performance, Ozoh will have gone a long way to doing that.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>He has been given few first-team opportunities since he became the club’s <a href=#>youngest Premier League player in January</a> but training full-time with the squad over the past two seasons has given him more time to adapt and develop.</p><p>Ozoh’s physical attributes are hard to ignore and help him cope at the higher level, particularly when confronted by a player of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=UhisEcoXihIhvXgn href=#>Rodri</a>’s size and ability, for example, but there is more to his game than raw physique.</p><p>His defensive diligence was impressive against City: he intercepted passes, closed the space and made some crucial tackles. One, on <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XPGfB4Asse0ZuH48 href=#>Phil Foden</a>, began the move for the penalty that led to Palace’s late equaliser, and he was also determined in his drive into the area that created the space for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=W5ne2zVYpd45vEyl href=#>Jean-Philippe Mateta</a> to coax the foul from Foden.</p><p><img width=4000 height=3000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/19074433/531989_8_2023_opta_dark_player_defensive_actions_plot.png alt sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There is work to be done on the technical side of his game, but Ozoh also showed impressive composure on multiple occasions to retain possession. He completed 91 per cent of his passes (10 of 11) and while most were simple, short and sideways or backwards, that was his remit in a defensive midfield role.&nbsp;</p><p><img width=4000 height=3000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/19074907/531989_8_2023_opta_dark_player_pass_map_plot.png alt sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Excellent” was Hodgson’s appraisal of Ozoh’s performance. He may stand a chance of earning a full debut against arch-rivals <a class=ath_autolink data-id=674 href=#>Brighton</a> on Thursday, although <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yTiUHQo3g4jmyp9W href=#>Will Hughes</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nPTsB7QqrQwUvyRY href=#>Jefferson Lerma</a> could both be available again, which would almost certainly deny him that opportunity.</p><p>Hodgson’s preference for experience, particularly in midfield, is understandable. He needs to trust that his players can work as a unit and frequently references the requirement to do defensive work when discussing attacking players.</p><p>One mistake could undermine the entire team’s work and that is a heavy burden to carry for a young player who has limited minutes at senior level. That can be applied to Ozoh but also to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xwZUMocRomu6S09c href=#>Matheus Franca</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ts7NzBN6QUVG06Zu href=#>Naouirou Ahamada</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=wzbY5gTQ9lOGgRup href=#>Jesurun Rak-Sakyi</a> — currently absent with a hamstring injury, although he has a season of football at <a class=ath_autolink data-id=692 href=#>Charlton Athletic</a> in League One to call upon.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Comments from Hodgson <a href=#>questioning his young players after defeats by Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur were clumsy</a>, but he was far more positive about their contribution in Manchester on Saturday.</p><p>Franca’s involvement was far more noticeable than it had been in his previous appearances. He linked well with Rak-Sakyi in the second half at <a class=ath_autolink data-id=679 href=#>Newcastle</a> but was yet to demonstrate anything meaningful. Against City, that changed: the 19-year-old beat <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ZTVFCfiA5I3chgf href=#>Kyle Walker</a> for pace and looked to expose the space behind the defence with speed that has not yet been seen.</p><p>“He had a very good cameo,” Hodgson said. “I’ve been expecting that. I’ve said to him on many occasions, ‘When you get your chance, I’m sure you’ll be OK’. It was a good moment for him to come on. I don’t know if it would have been as easy for him if he’d had that job from the start.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/19075954/GettyImages-1853388222-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Matheus Franca’s cameo at City impressed Roy Hodgson (Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)</span><p>There is a dilemma, though. Hodgson’s clear preference would be to introduce his young players gradually, as replacements for his first-choice XI when they are tiring or something different is required at the end of games. But when he has a full complement of players, opportunities will be more limited.</p><p>He has said that Franca has been ready to feature more regularly for a while, having previously cautioned that he needed time to adapt and that people had expected too much too soon from an inexperienced teenager new to the country.</p><p>Like Ozoh, Ahamada has had longer to acclimatise to the Premier League. The 21-year-old has shown fleeting glimpses of ability but has yet to make a significant impact or suggest he might break into the team with more involvement.</p><p>Other managers might be more prepared to take more risks, but blooding youngsters when there is so much at stake in the Premier League is difficult, especially when results are poor — as they have been for Palace since the November international break.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Whoever ultimately replaces Hodgson as manager will need to present a vision that makes the most of the academy and ties in with the recruitment strategy that focuses on developing younger talent. But everything will always come back to the priority of avoiding relegation.</p><p>For now, though, there should be more confidence that the young players on the fringes of this Palace squad can be relied upon when needed.</p><p>(Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGpra2xhZ3xzfJFsZmpqX2d9cK%2FRsqqtmZxivaK4wJycZpyRq7alec6zpqFlnZbBqbHUrGSfqpGjsKJ7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lil-tay-murder-what-happened-to-her-died-t-14.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lil Tay Murder: What Happened To The Influencer</a>
