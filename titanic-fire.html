April 15, 1912.</span></p><p>The latest in a long line of revisionist theories was put forth by Irish journalist Senan Molony. In the 2017 documentary Titanic: The New Evidence, he argues that a fire contributed to the ship’s devastating fate.</p><p>His theory started in an attic, where a treasure-trove of long-lost photographs of the Titanic were collecting dust. A descendant of the director of the company that built the ill-fated ship found the breathtaking images and later sold them to Molony.</p><p>The photographs show the Titanic as it was being constructed in Belfast, Ireland, before it set sail. Molony says the pictures are so important that they are “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamun’s tomb.”</p><p>While Molony <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pored over the old album</a>, he couldn’t help but notice a certain detail that fascinated him.</p>A CBS segment exploring the Titanic fire theory.<p>In one key image, shown in the video above, we see the Titanic leaving Belfast on April 2, 1912 (just over a week before it set sail from Southampton on its doomed maiden voyage). If you look closely, you can see a 30-foot-long black streak on the hull of the ship.</p><p>According to an analysis by engineers at Imperial College London, a fire that was raging in a coal bunker of the ship may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caused this damage</a>, therefore weakening the ship before it even began its voyage.</p><p>Molony explains that the existence of the fire has been long documented, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its significance has been underplayed</a>. He believes that the Titanic set sail despite the fire, and people who knew about it kept it quiet to avoid public scandal and a financial ruinous delay.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-256692 alt="Titanic captain on board " width=900 height=620 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/titanic-captain.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-256692 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ralph White/CORBID/Corbis | Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Captain Edward J. Smith and Purser Hugh Walter McElroy on the Titanic. They both went down with the ship.</span></p><p>Molony believes the crew tried to clear the burning coal bunker by moving it to the ship’s furnaces, making the ship itself go faster. And when the ship hit the infamous iceberg, it collided very close to the same already-weakened spot, causing the ship to sink faster.</p><p>So, the theory goes, the ship’s speed and the compromised structure both increased the impact of the iceberg against the ship during the collision, and therefore contributed to its sinking.</p><p>In the film, Molony declares, “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice, and criminal negligence… She should never had been put to sea.”</p><h2>Support For The Titanic Fire Theory</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-256688 alt="Lifeboats carry Titanic survivors" width=600 height=412 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/titanic-rescue-boats.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-256688 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Archives</span><span class=caption-body>Two lifeboats carry Titanic survivors to safety on April 15, 1912.</span></p><p>Beyond the photographs themselves, there are several contemporary eye-witness accounts that support the theory. Molony even points to an official inquiry made by British officials in 1912, in which a fire is mentioned but ultimately downplayed.</p><p>A crewman from the Titanic named Charles Hendrickson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in his testimony</a> that the side of the ship was warped from the fire and he “brushed it off and got some black oil and rubbed over it” to mask the damage.</p><p>Another testimony from Frederick Barrett <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">supports this</a>. He confirms that the “bulkhead running through the bunker” was damaged by the fire, and that “the bottom of the watertight compartment was dinged aft and the other part was dinged forward.”</p><p>And according to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">article published in the New York Tribune</a> just a few days after survivors arrived on land, the fire was still blazing when the ship set sail from Southampton. “In my opinion, this fire played no small part in the disaster,” an anonymous officer of the ship claimed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-256656 alt="Eye-witness claims that a fire contributed to the sinking of the Titanic." width=600 height=1339 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1officersaysfireplayednosmallpartnytrib20apr1912p6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-256656 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New York Tribune, via Senan Molony | Smithsonian</span><span class=caption-body>In this New York Tribune article, an officer of the ship claims that the fire contributed to the sinking of the Titanic.</span></p><p>Some experts today support the theory, such as a marine engineer named Richard de Kerbech. He agrees that the fire would indeed have damaged the ship’s bulkhead and made it more vulnerable to the piercing of the iceberg.</p><p>“This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened,” he said.</p><h2>Criticism And Consensus</h2><p>But not everyone is convinced. Some skeptics brush aside this explanation as one of many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiracy theories</a>, ranging from the ridiculous (an Egyptian mummy cursed it) to the sinister (millionaire banker J.P. Morgan plotted the ship’s demise to bring down his enemies on board).</p><p>Regarding the role of the fire, David Hill, the former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society, says that its significance is overplayed in this theory. He argues that while the fire may have accelerated things, “in my view, the Titanic would have sunk anyways.”</p><p>As with many historical mysteries, the full truth may be lost in the past.
